# Cyber Defence Quiz
## Introduction 
I currently work within the automotive manufacturing industry, which relies heavily on advanced machinery and digital technologies. The organisation depends on secure IT systems to support daily operations such as internal communication, manufacturing processes, and data management. As modern automotive environments become increasingly digitised, the protection of sensitive data and systems has become essential. 

Due to the rapid growth of digitalisation within the industry, cyber security has become a critical factor in maintaining operational integrity and protecting company information. Employees must understand common cyber threats such as phishing, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. However, the training currently provided by the organisation often relies on static materials, which do not actively assess employee understanding or engagement. 

To address this issue, I decided to develop a Cyber Defence Quiz Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The application will allow users to select relevant cyber security topics, answer multiple-choice questions, and receive immediate feedback on their responses. The system will calculate scores automatically and store results in a CSV file to enable basic performance tracking and analysis. 

This MVP is relevant to the workplace as it provides an interactive and measurable approach to improving cyber security awareness among employees. By encouraging active participation and tracking individual performance, the application supports continuous digital skills development in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

### GUI Design 
 the GUI was made using Figma to demonstarte the user interface and layout of the application before the development begins. the design focuses on making it relevent to organisations gudeline and lauouts. the application will be using blue grey colour scheme as it matches the BMW brand style.The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and ease of navigation to ensure an accessible user experience.

 The user Journey can be seen in the Figure 1 below
